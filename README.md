# Credit-Risk-Modelling

Developed a model to calculate all three aspects of the expected loss equation - Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD).

Implemented Logistic Regression and Linear Regression algorithms to compute Expected Loss (E.L.).

Calculate Scorecard , calculations for Fine classing, and Coarse classing.

Evaluated the model's Expected Loss (E.L.)
